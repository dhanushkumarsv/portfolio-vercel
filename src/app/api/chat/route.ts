      ULTRA-DETAILED RESEARCH & PROJECT KNOWLEDGE:
      
      1. GLYCEROL PURIFICATION (NEW):
         - Objective: Location selection and purification of crude glycerol from biodiesel byproducts.
         - Site Selection: Used ArcGIS Pro to analyze 135 sites in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Kota Bitung was selected for primary efficiency.
         - Simulation: Used Aspen Plus. Process involves HCl mixing, Flash separation (200°C, 1 bar), Vacuum Flash (250°C, 0.03 bar), and Vacuum Distillation.
         - Result: Achieved 97.16% purity. Processed 6,867 kg/h of crude feedstock. Optimal distillate-to-feed mole ratio is 0.866.
      
      2. HYBRID WASTEWATER TREATMENT (VMD-MED):
         - Objective: Treatment of Phosphogypsum (PG) wastewater from Croatia (Lonjsko Polje Nature Park).
         - Technology: Combined Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs) with VMD-MED and MSF-MED hybrid distillation.
         - Results: 90% phosphorus removal efficiency (struvite yield 6.8 kg/hr). 99.99% salt rejection. 
         - Impact: MEC-VMD-MED reduced thermal energy consumption by 25-35% and improved water production by 40-50% compared to standalone systems.
      
      3. DAIRY SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION (GAMS):
         - Objective: Optimizing milk collection networks in Tamil Nadu, India.
         - Methodology: Formulated a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in GAMS (v44.3.0) solved with CPLEX 22.1.1.
         - Results: Reduced logistics cost to ₹12 million per day. Collected 90% of milk within strict 4-hour time windows.
         - Trade-offs: Balanced total cost, unserved milk penalties (₹60/L), and GHG emissions (2.64 kg CO2/L diesel).
         
      4. PHOTOCATALYTIC HYDROGEN PRODUCTION:
         - Technology: Solar-driven hydrogen production from sulphuric wastewater using TiO2 photocatalyst.
         - Reactor: Designed and built a 4L trapezoidal acrylic photoreactor.
         - Results: Max output of 300 mL/h per liter. Optimized catalyst dose (0.2g/L) and sulphide concentration (0.2M).
         
      5. SKILLS & EXPERIENCE:
         - Aspen Plus & HYSYS: Mastered through Glycerol and VMD-MED projects.
         - GAMS & MILP: Expert in supply chain and process optimization.
         - ArcGIS Pro: Used for industrial site selection and spatial analysis.
         - Lab Skills: Photocatalytic reactor design, TiO2 activation (900°C muffle furnace), data analysis (Origin, Excel).
